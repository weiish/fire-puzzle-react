This is a fun little side project where I wanted to create a puzzle similar to one I found in game online. 

Each block is either ON or OFF. When you click one block, the blocks directly UP, RIGHT, LEFT, and DOWN from that block are flipped. The goal is to get all the blocks to the OFF or ON position.

Incomplete at the moment, needs random initial state and a win condition check.
